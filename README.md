# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the fulltime Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I think instead of just the circle background designs on each page; we could make the design of the circles look like coffee cup lids. It will take a little more time for sure but I think it'd look pretty sweet and refign the skills even more.
